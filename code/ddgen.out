9/8 All of the sudden your browser is allowing a webpage I visit, daily, to show a preview of five of their headlines in a popup window. Stop that. 9/10 My tabs are still closing randomly. Stop that as well. 9/12 Seriously, you have to stop closing my tabs. I will close them when I chose to close them.

This browser is a solid 10/10 Light af and clean. Firefox would be a 9,5/10 only because of ublock compared to this
---
FF Focus has been lagging in updates and developments. This is the only other browser that does the same, and does so well, and has a steady development.

So far so good... still see some false information on it via CNN, MSN, fact checkers, some false information on it, the reason I backed out of Google as a search engine
---
It's been an ease to use and it shows you what's blocked immediately. So far so good, I will continue to use this application as my 1st search engine.

============
Beats the heck out of Google. Ill admit that the search engine doesn't provide as great/accurate results as Google does, but it's not terrible and 100% gets my 5 star rating just the same.

Great Internet explorer and Search engine APP. Simple, Fast, Private & Secure. Without being bogged down with useless Google and Microsoft search results and a constant barrage of useless ad's wasting my time and slowing down my device.

Thank you for such a smooth running app.I let Chrome Google go . Was tired of the unwanted ads and lack of privacy.
---
All respect to the developers who developed this app, awesome app, and thank you for protecting my privacy. I really wanted to escape from Google. Thank you for creating this app and this app is the best browser app to block ads, thank you ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚

I like its messages telling me what it's doing, how it works. Like the tab views, the home screen search widget.
---
Would be nice to have a tab for bookmarks that could be set as like a home screen.

============
Like it., Gave it only 4 stars cause, hey, nobody's perfect. It's nice not having tracking and/ or cookies, and I didn't like the fact that Google used to be the only choice for Android users.
---
I like that it blocks 3rd party tracking and let's you know right away. I like that it doesn't store your info, rather I don't believe it does. It seem more private. Goodbye Google.

Very good app overall . However can not run the newest android 10 graphics updates . Hopefully it can be easily addressed  fingers crossed " . Keep up the good work!"
---
Very pleased with the block from ads. and without the annoyance of ads. reminding pop-ups as from other search engines. Keep up the good work of blocking all those pesky ads.
