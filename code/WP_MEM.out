It has become adware, asking for donations and requiring app interaction, and disabling the native Android back buttons, which is in violation of the Google Android API.
---
Awkwardly implemented tabbed viewing and confusing back button usage. Badly designed app.
---
The update caused the app to be moved from the external SD storage to internal storage.
---
It's a good app but just the same as Google but with videos minus 2 starsðŸ˜«ðŸ‘Ž
---
Very bad The results shown are wrost Search results doesn't appear. Don't install the app.

Very bad app. Do not have enough reason for support.

Garbage ass app drains all my battery

Nice app just you confirm the voice notifications.

The app is too slow in loading... Especially when searching for stuff

The app doesn't work, I can't search things there. I don't know why
---
app is broken on android 11
---
Good app but still need to include the sorting functionality when it comes to tables of data. It needs to have the ability to sort by column just like the Wikipedia on desktop browsers. Also images aren't being displayed. It's just a grey box.
---
It's not good when you force notifications, and that notification takes you to an external website. Thanks for the response but I had just updated the app on my tablet before that happened.
---
The app doesn't allow me to save articles to read them offline. The articles simply don't show up after saving them. Galaxy s8
---
A dependable app. A trusted app for all purposes,it gives you answers of any topic that you may inquire. I recommend it to both academics,professionals,politicians,military and any field you may request.
---
Very very Bad app in the world
---
I use app with xoss g+. It is slow, usually It connects to device after 10 tries. and most important it does not sync with strava, but syncs with training peaks
---
The article organization and table of contents have been messed up by the most recent update.

This app is good but something I include that's a proper search technic. I think this app is lack on it.

This is really good app but I think google must be include Google translate tool in it to translate a particular sentence in a particular language to easy to read. I know you include translation tool in it but it translate entire text which is not necessary sometimes.

This app is very poor and the editors are biased to specific communities. They don't accept true edits which doesn't suit their narrative.

This app keeps getting worse and worse. Today, without updating the app, I can no longer search Wikipedia for an article! It reports An error occurred" as soon as I enter a letter in the search field. I stopped the app
---
All of a sudden i literally cant search for anything. It was telling me that the search engine is busy. And now if i simply type a single letter into the search bar, even without pressing search, it gives me an error code.
---
I don't know whether it has to do with the new year or not, but I am unable to search on the app. It just keeps giving me an error 403 without even explaining it!

A wonderful app, that I have enjoyed using immensely, but, after last update, started giving me push notifications in Russian, without any prompt or say on my side.
---
I need to choose russian language for the app and maps. But the app uses device's settings only.
---
Great app. But no traffic updates in india. How do you show indian territory as part of china & pakistan?
---
Same app as waypoint, cannot plan trip with more than on stop.
---
Postal code cannot detect. Difficult app for navigation.very low mark. Definitely don't use it
---
I love this app but recently it is not straight and the navigation vehicle goes backwards. Can the app owners fix this?
---
Huawei Tablet M5 Lite last update the pointer is shaking and is not stable.

Really useful app. Latest update has changed the text style of hiking trail names, meaning they are now illegible which is incredibly frustrating.

With each update, this app becomes more cluttered. I wish i had not updated it after you bought this app.

Horrible app! The privacy violation and data collection that they do to you is horrendous!
---
The app leaks personally identifiable data to Facebook, without permission or knowlegde from the user and without any Facebook login. The developer claims that they have to use the Facebook SDK therefore they have no choice over leaking the data.

Pure junk. Determine a route of travel? Nope. Measure distance between two points? Uh nuh. Use for any kind of navigation? Negatory! Delete and advise potential users about this waste of time? Absolutely!
---
Suggestions: 1. Add home screen shortcut of navigation destination 2. Route overview / navigation view switch. Basically a min/max zoom switch with proper orientation 3. Provide alternative route with time/distance difference information in overview mode.

This app is cool and all and gets the job done. But (and it's a big but) you really really need to make sure mobile data doesn't get wasted updating maps. I guess an auto download started over Wi-Fi but of course didn't finish when I closed the app. I discovered that the app kept trying to resume updating my maps upon each opening - when I was on mobile data and not Wi-Fi. As a result I have turned off automatic map updating. There should be an option to auto update over Wi-Fi only!
---
This used to be my absolute favorite app! Used it daily. I have over 100 pins and don't want to loose them. But ever since update came out about a year ago, I can no longer get in. Any map I use wants to first download an update but it will not download. Just spins and spins. Help! I really miss maps w me!!ðŸ˜Ž

Why is the app required to be open when downloading/updating maps?? use an android service to do it in the background! so it continues to download/update even when the app is closed. / Annoyed that this hasn't been fixed yet, uninstalling, will start using Google Maps again which DOES have this feature for its offline maps.
---
Excruciatingly annoying Impossible to search without app insisting on downloading more maps. Deleting. Even after downloading a bunch of maps the app doesn't allow route planning. Just the boring freeways. Might as well use Waze or Google Maps. The search goes on.
