Edit: The app is completely nonfunctional when I'm using NordVPN...which is frustrating considering this browser is marketed to people who value security and privacy. My only complaint is that the spacebar on the keyboard is too small, and I constantly end up typing periods on accident.

I have the Bitdefender Total Security 2020 mobile app which also includes an anti-virus software. The DuckDuckGo browser is not on the protected browser list so I no longer using it.

Hi - two stars. No option to import or export bookmarks. No option to install add ons. The only good thing is the browser can be configured.
---
Ooh. Adware. My daughter tried to warn me. I would turn notifications off. For your app. But. I haven't had to do that. For any other mobile browser. Ever. We've got you covered. You've got this. You can browse safely" or some crop like that. Other dopier messages. I don't like pointless notifications. Don't need em. Your browser isn't tor anyway. Quite useless. Uninstalling. Microseconds. After posting this. You are immature dimwits. Cheers."

Good browser. I rated only three stars and will increase it to five if the developers add in a way to better organize bookmarks. I would like to see a drop-down menu like Google Chrome and Internet Explorer have for organizing bookmarks.
---
Pretty good browser. Devs should add the ability to rearrange bookmarks. Would rate it higher if they did.
---
Would move to this browser in a heartbeat if there was the means to import bookmarks. Seems like this would be a standard function within a browser app.

So, this app is a overall good, private browser that protects you. My problem, is that you can just download something like Cake ‚Ñ¢ or Yandex‚Ñ¢ and be protected while it's still going fast. That's it.
---
This app is very good and best but 1 problem if i download something i don't stop or pause this downloading. So please solve this problem or bug in your system hurry. .......by the way i am from india. And 1 more problem if i download something from your browser so those file is not moved in my memory

I'd love to use this search engine but Google just has it nailed. Apple maps is awful compared to Google and duckduckgo just doesn't flow right. It's not as slick or as user friendly. Genuinely gutted.

Hi, love app but fyi, it still wont open from homepage, I am using latest version of android on Samsung Galaxy Note 9. Yes! They have share functionüëçüòâ I use this search engine for any serious research that is scrubbed by Google. Thank you for keeping it realüëèüëèüëè
---
Why is the word Google written on the spacebar now? Does the app use Google's search engine? How can I choose which search engine to use?

App keep.jumping confront of other apps as if I have to use it or will not give me access to other app.
---
Download ecosia instead- it has similar elements but it also plants real life trees as you use the app.
---
Why is this app not honoring my auto update settings? I use it, but please DO NOT by pass my settings.

Such a waste of time, my Samsung tablet frozed up when I tried to open it, worst case scenario is that it didn't do one bit to block any ads at all.
---
Just tried it to see if it can block ads and it's completely useless. I dont recomand wasting your time with this

Loading speed is awfully slow & most of the time, it's not even loading at all. Moving on to the next reliable app.
---
Lately this app has been loading very slowly and in occasion it doesn't even load completely. I like the app but it's lost quality.

It was great and then suddenly sucks, it must be the updates, I can't even open/read my email on gmail without switching to the basic html format so have to uninstalled it

I can't download most files, from .pdf, .docx, to apk It's a suffering knowing they haven't patched this for months or even years.

Too slow. Also when u go back a page, it takes u to a blank page and u have to type in your search again.
---
Everytime I visit a page, go switch to something else, then come back, the page is blank and I have to reload the page to get it back.

After this latest update I cannot connect to internet through this browser ,always show webpage is not available.
---
I just started to use this browser, so I will update this review later, I left it at 3 stars for neutral for now
---
What good is a browser that keeps no records if you ISP is keeping track of everything you do?! Someone somewhere is always watching!!
---
Tried to ID mystery icons; found help/ instructions do not exist; or hidden within privacy boasting about" pages
---
Can be buggy. Pages don't always load unless you toggle windows. Weird glitch. I appreciate the privacy sentiment but the browser has to be functional.

Thank you for the privacy but somehow spam still got through and found my phone number. I'm still not sure how.

the mobile phone version ensures privacy. Laptop/PC Version of Chrome extension does not do so and shows all links. I have installed in another phone but all suggestions /complaints of missing Search box and widget have got no response.

It's really good But there's one problem. Everytime i open a new tab. To read a recipe or something else. And when i close the tab and want to go back to the page i was on before it goes white and don't do anything. And it takes several minutes and when i have pressed back several times it goes back to start
---
Edit.It used to be the absolute best browser. But the last few months its been some really annoying problem. When i open a new tab to look at a recipe or a picture or anything and then i close the tab and want to go back to the page i had open but its all white stays so for several minutes and sometimes it goes back to the page but most times it either go back to start of this app or it goes back to my home screen. Its extremely annoying especially when there isn't history and open tab that way
---

back button from a newly-opened tab does not take you back to the original page/tab that you started from. while the browser has some nice features, until this issue is fixed, the app is unusable.
---
Having issue when using back button browser. When used doesn't to previous page, but exits app altogether.

It's nice to have a privacy app. However it is not immune from political bias. Seems the search algorithms present almost entirely left wing viewpoints/sites.
---
Well, ...It is GREATLY appreciated to have the option to search without goo gle next to us....however,...How about a DuckDuckGo Gps navigation app?

I like the feeling of security, but the browser locks up too frequently for 10 or 20 seconds each time. Needs a fix.
---
Like there needs to be a tutorial" for an f***ing browser. This Browser has done nothing but gone downhill."

What I don't like about this is when you search there's no previous or next page facility. It's extreamly annoying.
---
It doesn't work after the latest upgrade. It looks like it is working, but after i hit search the page is just completely blank.

Is a good app overall but after the last update it wont remember any settings and that cloud function wants you to log in every time you open the app. Definitely a downgrade. Bit disappointed.
---
Since the last update, my settings (theme, country, units etc.) are being changed to default every time I exit the app. Please fix this

One of the worst browser, full of ads. Cookies, irritating , automatically downloads ads and app links, this app should have negative rating .0
---
No adblocker, it irretates with ads & 1 suggestion adblocker+inbuilt VPN can make this app the best one.

My apologies. Every browser I've tried crashes. It must be my Huawei phone? It never did this till Corona hit!

Thank you for all the youtube ads! How did you know that my privicy does not matter to you and I love all the useless ads. Great job.... NOT!

Too bad that you guys partnered with Yandex. Now I keep seeing Russian ads that I don't even understand and I don't know how this browser is any safer now because of this.

Trackers are not blocked. I did one search for a Dell computer using this and right when I went to facebook guess what Dell computers were being advertised.

Claims to not censor. I have searched controversial subjects where both sides of the argument were displayed. Awesome! Unfortunately now you search these subjects and they are very one-sided and biased. Too bad you guys have seem to sold out.
---
============ end of one review of DD
It censors results. I checked results against Google and Bing, and adult sites we're all filtered. I also checked news sites, same again. This is a real shame.
---
Watching YouTube makes the browser flash uncontrollably. It also makes the keyboard unaccessible. This broswer has extremely poor search results. The massive inconvenience is not worth it.
---
It's just not ready to play with the other browsers yet. Also, their search results are worse than bing's.

So, unlike every other browser in the world, tapping back" exits the browser rather than closing the current tab to return focus to the parent tab? ... And there's no setting to change this? ... Unfortunately I cannot afford the time necessary to reprogram my reflexes just because you cannot program a browser."
---
Great browser. One complaint that ruins the experience is that it starts saving files as .bin And i have to clear cache every time - I'd rather switch to another browser

Doesn't respond to near me"...brought up Florida and I'm in Arizona. When I typed in my town and state the app brought up 1 gas station and there are actually 4. (This was just a test). I love the idea of some privacy but I'll wait."

This app turns on your mic so I uninstalled, they claim to protect your privacy but there the ones spying on you, be very careful there not what they claim be.
